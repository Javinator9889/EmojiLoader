/**
 * Global interface that must be implemented by the bundled emoji class
 * itself. Currently, this is used by [com.javinator9889.bundledemoji.BundledEmojiConfig]
 * class, which provides an easy-to-use object for loading all the available emojis at once.
 *
 * Since version 1.0, this is also used by [EmojiConfigGMSLoader] class for loading from
 * Google Play Services.
 *
 * This is interesting for:
 *  + Loading all emojis directly for slow or old phones.
 *  + Be able to use every emoji independently if the phone has or not Google Play Services.
 *  + Use this application with third party providers such as F-Droid or similar.
 *  + Embed the fonts directly into the device so the app can work mostly offline.
 *
 * But, take in mind that embedding the fonts in the APK file carries a HUGE increase in size
 * (estimated about ~4 MB), so prefer using the Google Play Services font loading.
